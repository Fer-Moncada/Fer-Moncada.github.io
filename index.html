		<h2>Early years: School</h2>
			<p>I was born in Latacunga city, in Ecuador on November 24th, 1994. My parents are Manuel Moncada and Sofía Gutiérrez. My father is a taxi driver while my mom is a housewife. Since a kid I always was interested in maths and numbers. I am an only son, so I was not very friendly and I always invented games for myself. My first four years I live in "Joseguango bajo", a rural community of Latacunga city; I do not recall a lot from this years but. My first year of studies was at "María Montesori" kindergarden in Latacunga city. Later, I wen to study school at "Clu Rotario" school. I was not the most popular kid but I had some friends and I always was the smartest kid in the class; however due to my ugly writing I was not recognize officially as such. My teacher of seventh grade recommended me to study physics because I destacated so much in maths even though a that time I wanted to be a medic.</p>
		<h2>High School</h2>
			<p>I decided to study High School at "Primero de Abril". I continue destacating in Maths during the first three years of High school so I decided to study Maths and Physics at baccalaureate. However, I was called by the career advisor of the high school who told me about the International baccalaureate. This was the first turning point in my life. </p>
			<p>I accepted to study the Ib program because it consituted a unique opportunity to study both "Maths and Physics" and "Chemestry and biology". Even though I had decided to study Maths and Physics at that time, I still had the dream to be a medic. This program aimed for both speacilizations so it was a huge opportunity and I was willing to take it.</p>
			<p>In this program I me some of my most important friends. We were just twelve selected students at the class, we did not know each other and our teachers love us and encourages to get the best of us. In this program I studied Literature, History and biology at high level and Maths, Physics at standard level and English at Ab initio level. We had three other components which comprised Creativity, Action and Service; Theory of knowledge and the monography which I made in physics. </p>
			<p>Here comes the second turning point in my life. At first year of baccalaureate I had a teacher in physics that did not know anything about physics (at that time I thought I was the one who did not know physics; however, now as a physicist I know he was the one who didnot know). Indeed, I discovered that the next year with a new professor in physics Dr. Fernando Santana. He was kind of a mentor to me and with such classes I fell in love with physics and I knew what I wanted to be in life. </p>
			<p>Time pass by and the final evaluations for the international baccalaureate program came. All of my friends were dissapointed because our biology and maths teacher were bad and there were no chance for us to achive the diploma. However, I comitted to the task of learning everything I could until the day of the test and everything was good until the penultimate test of biology which I was not able to study as much as I wanted beacuse I was so tired of the whole month of tests. Days later, I receive a message in my phone from my CAS teacher who told me I have approved the program. I was in the taxi with my father in front of the fireman station (I will never forget the exact place were I was when I receive that awesome news). Approving the Ibprogram for me was a huge accomplishment and I was really excited beacuse I wanted to study overseas.</p>
		<h2>College</h2>
			<p>The math section of my test for entreance to the university was perfect, however due to some synonyms of spanish language I needed just a third of a point over one thousand points (as close as one can be) to geta scholarship to study anywhere in the world. I was so disapoinetd, however in retrospective, I think it was the best option. The ecuadorian goverment left abandoned many scholars around the world and also I would have had to work ten years in Ecuador until travelling abroad for a postgraduate program or for work. I ended up studying Physics at Escuela Politecnica Nacional, arguably the best university in the country. I was not happy at the begining beacuse I wanted to study physics at Harvard. With the pass of time, I learn to love my career (I always love physics) and little by little became arguably the best student of the career. </p>
			<p>I have never failed a subject at college. I was accepted to present a work at Universidad Industrial de Santander in bucaramanga Colombia were I earned the first place with my poster presentation. This was my favorite day in my whole life so far. It was my birthday: November 24th, 2017. I started the day in a discothec in a country I have never been before with many physicst I became friends with, just this week. Friends I never knew they existed just a week before. They were amazing and the whole discothect congratulated me in my birthday. I ended up that night drinking with the roomates until the 4 am in the morning, like a rock star. I woke up at 11 in the morning and I run to the clausere of the event. I just get there and less than two minutes later I heard they called me as the winner of the best poster presentation. I could not beleive that but it was real. Later that day I went to a five stars hotel, payed by my university as part of my trip (everything was payed since I won a scholarship for the whole event). I was in the sky, everything was perfect for me: My professional career was amazing, at that time I had the girlfriend of my dreams and even though everything always worked out for me, I have never been so happy as that time. </p>
			<p>The time past and I graduated as a physicst. This was an amazing day in company of my family and a lot of my friends. Then I had a great period of full happiness, I had no responsability, no oligations, no problems. I just have to wait for my professional title to be legalized in order to get any of the job offers I had. I spend that time with my friends and travelling. I helped a little in the development of the Simbiosis festival, an divulgative initiative of some friends in Macas city, in the ecuadorian forest. When I was in this festival I get another job offer from the Physics Department of my University. Inmmeditely I mailed my resume and at the end of the process I was one f the winners of the selection and I was contrated as a teaching technician for the Physics Laboratory. </p>
		<h2>Work</h2>
			<p>I worked there for almost three years and it was a great job. There, I have been able to solve all the problems we faced. On February 2020 I won a scholarship to study a master degree of Physics Applied to Medicine and Biology at Sao Paulo University. I was thrilled to study that in country whose language I did not knew but I have started to learn. I get the visa, the plane tickets, quit my job and I was ready to travel while COVID19 strikes and crashed all my plans to the ground. I felt so disapointed at that time. In retrospective, it was for the best. I could get back my job, I was able to help my parents since they lose their means of susistence and I learned about different opportunities.</p>
			<p>In fact, during the lockdows due the the covid19 pandemic, I learned many things. Since I thought I will be studying the MSc Degree in Brasil, i learn portuguese. Also, the thesis projected i wanted to work there was focused on machine learning applications to medical physics, so I learn artificial intelligence too. Also, this time allowed me to meet my current girlfriend, to this day I'm very happy with her. Furthermore, I applied to several options for an MSc degree in medical physics. On December of 2020, I was accepted to study Medical Physics at Glasgow University in the UK. In order to study at UK, I needed a full scholarship, so I applied to Chevening scholarships. Unfortunately, I didn't earn that scholarship. At the same time, I was applying to an MSc Degree in Medical Physics at UNAM in Mexico. This program seem even better and I went for it all the way.</p>
		<h2>Postgraduate: MSc</h2>
			<p>On February 2021 I started studying at UNAM the propedeutic course online. This course had three tests with contents from five subjects on each test. I get great grades on each of the five subjects and I exempet them all. I was the only student to do that. I was very happy about it and I decided to get my fourth tattoo the day I would have had to take the final test. That's how I get accepted to study at UNAM and a scholarship at the same time. I beging working on the paper work to get ready to leave my country and travel to Mexico. I quit my job, again. I say farewells to my girlfriend, my friends and my family and I travel to Mexico on July 22nd, 2021. I get to Mexico City the same day and live on an airbnb for five days until I rent a department near on UNAM university. After legalizing my migrant status and some paper work about the university and visa, I started clases on August.</p>
			<p>We expected to have face-to-face clases; unfortunately, covid cases raised once again and the whole semester was given online. I had clases of anatomy and fisiology, radiation physics and dosimetry, dosimetry laboratory, instrumentation and signals and principles of cell biology. I enjoy all of this classes and in most of them, the teachers were great. Also, I started working on my thesis project, again focused on artificial intelligence, applied to medical physics. In this case, my aim is to correct the artifacts produced by scatered radiation on CBCT images, using convolutional neural networks. During this time I learned a lot and I have to work a lot too. By the end of the semester, I earn a perfect degree on each subject. Also, during this time I visited many turistic places in Mexico City. I visited Chapultepec, Palacio de las Bellas Artes, El Z\'ocalo de la Independencia, El \'Angel de la Independencia, El monumento a la revoluci\'on, la biblioteca central de la UNAM y la Bas\'ilica de la Virgen de Guadalupe.</p>
			<p>By the end of the year, I traveled back to Ecuador to spend the holidays with my girlfriend. Before the flight, I was afraid something my go wrong because of travel restrictions due to Omicron spread; however, everything happened as wished. I spend a week with my parents and the night after Christmas, I started a cross country journey with my girlfriend. We begin at Quito, the we travel to Mont\~nita, my favorite beach in Ecuador. After that we visit to beaches more. We went to salinas where we enjoy the blue sea and blue sky from a boat. We see the sunset at Santa Elena, at Ballenita beach. Then we travel to the highlands. We spend new year's eve in Cuenca. We walked a route of almost five hours at Parque Nacional Cajas. On 2022, we traveled to Macas, a beautiful city of ecuadorian jungle. We meet there with two ecuadorian physicist which are making their PhDs at Europe. Later, we went to Puyo, another city in the middle of the jungle. Finally we went to Ba\~nos, one of the most beautiful and touristic cities in Ecuador. We enjoy so many places there, like El Pailon Del Diablo, La casa del duende, las manos de Dios, la mano de la pachamama, la ruta de las cascadas, animal park and many more. We planned to visit El Quilotoa lake in Cotopaxi; however due to some academic responsabilities we couldn't travel there. I had to change some images of a paper which was accepted for publication. Overall, this trip has been one of my most amazing experiences in my life. </p>
			<p>On January, I travelled again to Mexico to continue my studies. The subjects I took this year was Radiological protection, physics of radiotherapy, physics of medical images and radiobiology. My favorite subject was the Physics of Medical Imaging. I get a perfect score on all subjects except radiological protection. On holy week, I travel to Puebla with some of my frinds from the MSc program and we spend a marvelous time there. We went to the Cholula pyramid, which is the largest in the world and we also visited Val'Quirico, a magical town of Tlaxcala. We party a lot at nights in Puebla and Saa Andres of Cholula; it was a great time and a lot of excesses. At the end of the semester, I went to a Cannibal Corpse concert whih was an amazing way to end a hard-worked semester. </p>
			<p>On July, I travel to Valparaiso, Chile to visit my girlfriend who move to live there since March because of her PhD. As soon as I arrived to Valparaiso I felt a huge pain in my stomach which I attributed to my gastritis and the fact that I didn't eat enough during the flight. I spend a month in Chile and was marvelous. I travel with my girlfriend to the Atacama dessert. We get to know frozen salt lakes and beautiful places. We also visited some friends from our University in Santiago de Chile and in Valparaiso. We visited several times Viña del mar, one of the most wonderful attractions in the region. We also went to the dunas of Concon which was amazing. The weather in this region is very cold and I did not get used to it and I had to wear a lot of clothes all the time. At the end of my trip, I felt sick again of my stomach after eating a fried fish. The last week of July, my girlfriend had four test to became a PhD candidate and she pass 3 of them; I'm so proud of her. Next year she will be taking the Quantum Mechanics test. Before I travel again to Mexico I had a problem with my girlfriend, but fortunately we were able to manage and get through it.</p>
			<p>In Mexico I visited again a doctor in order to understand what is happening with my stomach. On September and October had two more episodes of such pain and I ended up in an emergency room. A doctor from my university told me it were digestive trastorns in my gut, due to stress and anxiety and gave me pills in case of pain which worked great later on October when I had two more episodes. Another doctor of the Mexican Social Security programmed many exams to ruled out another problems and I still have some pening examinations. Since November I had not felt any problems at all, but I still do not known with certainty what was the issue and if it still remains. I had change a lot my diet. Another factor that I think contributed to my health issues is the medical residence I took this year because each week I had different schedules and it was hard to had my meals at a given time. </p>
			<p>The third semester of my MSc program was the most difficult. This semester I had the medical residency and almost each week I went to different services of the Instituto Nacional de Cancerlogia in Mexico City. I had a lot of expectations of my medical residency; unfortunately it was a huge deception. Most of people in charge of it did not care about the residents and also gave a lot of homework which I understand should not be the objective of it. Some of the homeworks just did not make sense. This and my health issues gave me a hard time this semester. In contrast, the results of y MSc thesis had been wonderful and I presented them four times:  three oral contributions and one poster presentations. I presented my work at the XVII Mexican Simposium on Medical Physics, LXV National Congress in Physics and XVIII Congress of PCF-UNAM students. And the poster was presentes at the Medical Imaging Conference of the 2022 IEEE NSS MIC RTSD in Milan, Italy. In all cases I had a great feedback and congratulations. Also we sent a manuscript for the conference proceeedings of the XVII MSMP, which has been accepted for publications without corrections./p>
			<p>Thanks to the poster I presented in Italy, I had the opportunity to visit Europe for the first time and it was wonderful. But previously, trying to get a visa was very hard. The italian embassy has an awful site and I cannot get a date with the embassy; the webpage always went down at 0:00 of Rome. Fortunately, I decided to get the visa at the Austrian embassy quick and without any complication, for tourism instead of studies. So, I travel to Vienna and visited the city, the casttles and the graveyard were Boltzmann and Beethoven are buried. The parlament, hofburg, belvedere palace and St. Stephen Cathedral were my favorite places. In Vienna I was received by Wolfwang Gilits, the brother in law of my MSc tutor. He and her wife, Martha Martinez were very frindly and supportive and help me to understand the european culture. Then I travel to Budapest by train and I was astonished by its marvelous casttles, its people and parks. The Danube and the Parlament are amazing. Then I went to Prague by plane. I love its palaces, the Charles Bridge and the Astronomical Clock. The next day I went to Kutna Hora because I wanted to visit the Sedlec Ossuarium, a chatolic bone chappel with thousands of human bones used as decoration. This was my favorite part of the trip, I love this place. Later that day, in Prague I visited the sex machines museum and teh National Museum. I was happily surprised on how well my trip went since I knew nothing of Czech or Hungarian languages; but, people there are very frindly and understand you in English very well. Then, I travelled to Milan by plane.</p>
			<p>In Milan I went to the conferences and later I visited the most iconic places such as the Duome, the Arc of Peace and another bone chappel, the San Bernardino alle Ossa which was astonishing as well. In the conferences I spend time with Mercedes Rodriguez, a professor of my University and other former students of UNAM. I went to an Ecuadorian place called El Idolo with Alan, a newly made frind from Mexico who lives in Belgium. The food there was delicous. Also I met with another friend of my undergraduate university, Criss. She is from Ecuador and she's studying also Medical Physics and we talked a lot since it has been a long time since we haven't seen each other. Later, we met with an uzbek friend of her who is also a medical physicist student. The last days of the conference I travel to Rome by train.</p>
			<p>In Rome I met with another friend of my ecuadorian University. She is also studying an MSc in physics in Italy. Shen went from La Calabria to Rome to spend a couple of days there. We visited the Roman Colosseum, The Vatican, The Fontana di trevi, The Altar della patria and many more attractions. The roman colosseum is the second of the seven wonders of the world that i have visited. We also went to an Ecuadorian food restaurant but there the attention was not good. Then I continued my journey back to Mexico, so first I had to went back to Vienna by plane. This time I get to know a little bit more of the city but this days was very cold. I spend the night at a Space home hotel which were capsules with spatial thematic that I love. Finally, I took the plane back to Mexico City with a connection in Madrid. This has been the most wonderful and adventorous trip I have ever had.</p>
			<p>Back in Mexico, I finished my third semester with perfect scores. I finished the medical residency. I decided to pursue a PhD. At my 28th birthday I was amazed to see that from my 27th birthday to my 28th birthday I had travelled through 10 countries and 33 cities jumping on 17 planes. At the end of the semester I went to hell and heaven festival in Toluca. It was amazing and I see a live performance of Butcher Babies, Stryper, Mercyful Fate and Kiss at the Hell Stage. Also I enjoyed the performances of Anthrax and Megadeth at Heaven stage that was less than 50 meters away. Then I travell again to Chile to spend Christmas and New Year's wve with my girlfriend. </p>
			<p>I spend the end of the year in Chile with my girlfriend. We had a great time together; however, we have some health issues. First, in my flight to Bogota, I had another episode of pain associated to my gastritis issues but it was immediately solve with my medication. . We went to Viña del Mar to spend Christmas and we eat a delicious food: a grilled octupus and later we went to the wonderful beaches of Viña and spend Christmas Eve on Valparaiso. </p> 
			<p>The next day, the 25th of dicember, we travel to Brazil, to Foz do Iguacu. We stayed for four days at Ciudad del Este in Paraguay where we visited the Hito of The Three Fontiers that is a triple border between Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina and the beautiful Lake of the city. Then we went to Puerto Iguazu in Argentine when we do trekking at the Iguazu Falls, one of the seven natural wonders of the world. This was one of the most beautiful places we have ever been and we were amazed by the beautiful nature landscapes. I love the high temeratures there, but my girlfriend not so much. The last day we get to know Foz do Iguacu where I practice a little bit of my portuguese and have some troubles because we went to the worng terminal and for a moment we thought we might loss the flight. But at the end, we get there on time and finish right a wonderful trip. </p>	
			<p>After hat, I stayed three weeks at Valparaiso. We went to Dunes of Concon and Oceanic Rock were we did a wonderful photoshoot. This was one of my favorite trips ever and we had such an adventure. Also, during this time we advance on our research projects. Then we travel together to Santiago to he Airport where my girlfriend took a planee to Ecuador and I took a plane to Mexico. </p>
			<p>In Mexico Ifinish my research project. Also I went to Motley Crue and Def Leppard concert at Foror del Sol in Mexico City. It was an amazing concert but unfortunately at first row Ocesa included chairs, in a rock concert, what an awful idea. In Februar I finished my masters thesis and begin to collect the documents for my graduation. Also I apply to a PhD program at UNAM university, under the supervision of Dr. Arnulfo Martinez, my master's tutor. Also I started woring on an online job of tutoring students with physics problems at Tutor.com. Also in this period I finished reading The Stand from Stephen King, my favorite book so far.</p>
			<p>On march, I went back to Ecuador during my vacations of the Holy week. I visited my parents and get some documents from ecuadorian authorities. I also visited my former University where I visited former students and professors. It was a nice experience. I have a lot of grattitude with EPN. I also make some tourism in Quito, Latacunga and El Quinche, where we went with my parents.</p>
			<p>On april I went back to Mexico and started to collect the documents for my MSc graduation. All of the members of the jury approve my MSc thesis. Furthermore, I get accepted to study I PhD at UNAM at the same line of research, specifically in a project where I will evaluate regularization methods such as Total Variation and regularization based on Deep Learning approaches to applied to Positron Emission Mammography to solve the limited angle and noise limitations. Also I went to Grutas de Tolantong with a friend. So far, it is the best place i have visited in Mexico. The pozas, the cascade, the grotto and the cyan river are beautiful. In this period of time I finish reading A tale of two cities, a wonderfull book from Charles Dickens. </p>
			<p>At the end of June I flew to Chile to spend my vacations with my girlfriend and I have a great time. We spend a lot of time in Viña del Mar. I love the sunsets in Viñas's beaches. We visited a beautiful lake in Curauma and the best part was a trip to the chilean andes, specifically to Portillo. For the first time i was at a place with negative temperatures (-2°C). We enjoy a lot the place, the snow and La Laguna del Inca. It was a wonderful trip and we were pñaying in the snow like kids. The only negative thing in this trip was that my health issues came back.</p>			
			<p>On July 24th I came back to Mexico and the 24th I defended successfully my MSc thesis and I graduated as MSc in Medical Physics. It was a wonderful day, but it was affected by my health issues again. The next day I deliver the required documentation to start my PhD and then I continue looking for a solution with my health issues. Finally I decided to book a gallbladder surgery. Days before the surgery my health complicated really bad and the doctor said that also I would need a CPRE, which made the proceddure very expensive. On August 6th, finally my gallbladder was successfully removed and the biliar conducts were clenaed after a complicated surgery. It was programmated as a laparoscopic proceddure, unfortunatelly an open surgery was needed. The first days of recovery were very difficult and the worst part was to follow a strict diet without any fats. I was lucky to have a great friend here, Santiago, who take care of me during this difficult period. As the days gone by, I recover more and I was able to relax a little bit on the diet.</p>		
			<p>On August 7th I started my PhD studies. Due to the health difficulties associated to the week before the surgery, I was in a bad mental status and I consider the option of leaving my PhD studies. The first couple of weeks I took classes online because of my surgery. In this period of time I won a economic stimulus for early graduation, which was a great blessing to compensate the high expenses of my surgery. My research has been going marvelous. The subject that I am taking is Electrodynamics. I like this subject, however it is too repetitive with the knowledge I have already got in my undergraduate courses. During this time I read the book La maldici\'on del Inca, which was a great book from an ecuadorian author: Alexander Angamarca. Unfortunately, there has been some unexpected difficulties associated with the scholarship.</p>
